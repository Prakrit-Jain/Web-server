# Web Server 

### Building a Multithreaded Web Server

This repo contains a rust simple project in which we learn to make a web server that says “hello” 

Here is our plan for building the web server:

1. Learn a bit about TCP and HTTP.
2. Listen for TCP connections on a socket.
3. Parse a small number of HTTP requests.
4. Create a proper HTTP response.
5. Improve the throughput of our server with a thread pool.


Use `cargo run` to run the program.
